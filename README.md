# Intel 8080 Emulator
This is a hardware emulator of the Intel 8080 processor, the original processor used in many old arcade machine games. Support for arcade games includes Space Invaders, and in-progress versions of several other arcade machines using similar hardware. Current OSs supported are: Linux. 

## Running the Emulator
1. Ensure that your Linux OS has the following dependent libraries: SDL2.0 and all other dependencies associated, GLFW, wxWidgets
2. Run the binary executable titled "emulator" and play!

## Playing Games
### Controls
#### Space Invaders
C - insert Coin, Arrow Keys - move left and right, Enter - start P1, Spacebar - Shoot

### Gameplay
Space Invaders runs as the same frequency that it ran on the original hardware, so any slowdown in the gameplay is due either to processor slowdown or the original speed of the hardware.
